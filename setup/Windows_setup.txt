Instructions to setup your virtual environment using pyenv on Microsoft Windows:

1. Install pyenv:
    1.1 Download the zip file of the following GitHub repository:
          https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win
    1.2 Create a new folder .pyenv in your user folder with the name .pyenv by typing the following command in the Windows PowerShell:
           mkdir $HOME/.pyenv
    1.3 Extract the ZIP-archive in your downloads folder and copy the pyenv-win folder and the .version file from the pyenv-win-master folder into the newly created .pyenv folder in your user folder.
    1.4 Set the environment variables PYENV and PYENV_HOME that point to the installation folder:
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV_HOME',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")
    1.5 Add the bin folder to the PATH variable such that pyenv can be found when using the command line:
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\bin;" + $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\shims;" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('path', "User"),"User")
    1.6 Close the current Windows PowerShell.
    1.7 Start a new Windows PowerShell with admin privileges by right-clicking on the Windows PowerShell icon in the start menu and choose Run as administrator.
    1.8 Enter the following command into the PowerShell to enable the execution of scripts (press A to choose Yes to ALL):
           Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    1.9 Close the current Windows PowerShell.
    1.10 Start a new Windows PowerShell.
    1.11 Type the following command to make sure that pyenv has been installed successfully:
           pyenv
    1.12 If you encounter a security warning from where you have to choose if you want to run pyenv you can disable this warning by “unblocking” the pyenv script with the following command:
           Unblock-File $HOME/.pyenv/pyenv-win/bin/pyenv.ps1

2. Open a new command line/terminal.

4. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgiosIoannouCoder/vera.git

5. Navigate to the cloned repository folder:
    cd vera

6. Use the installed Python version in the cloned repository folder:
    pyenv local 3.10.8

7. Create virtual environment in the cloned repository folder:
    python -m venv .vera-venv

8. Activate the virtual environment:
    .\.vera-venv\Scripts\activate

9. Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

10. Install ipykernel:

11. Install Jupyter Notebook:
    pip install jupyter notebook

12. Add the kernel of the virtual environment in the Jupyter Notebook:
    ipython kernel install --user --name=.vera-venv

13. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook

14. Select the .vera-venv kernel to run the Jupyter Notebook.

14. Navigate to frontend:
    cd frontend

15. Look at the .env.txt file of this repository for the file paths.
