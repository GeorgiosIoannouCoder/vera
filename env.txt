Your .env file should like like this:

backend_path = "path/to/the/backend/directory/of/this/project"
project_path = "path/to/the/root/directory/of/this/project"

model_path = "path/to/the/model.h5"
X_path = "path/to/the/X.parquet"
y_path = "path/to/the/y.parquet"


# NOTE: model.h5, X.parquet, and y.parquet are generated by the vera-notebook.ipynb. If you want
# them either run the vera-notebook.ipynb or please feel free to contact me.
